//Note my idea
//Found it in solutions, Liked the approach
//My idea was to copy all the nodes to an array say "arr" and retrun arr.slice(arr.length/2)

var middleNode = function(head) {
    let fast = slow = head;
    while (fast && fast.next) {
        fast = fast.next.next;
        slow = slow.next;
    }
    return slow;
};
